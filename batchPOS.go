// BatchPOS holds the BatchHeader and BatchControl and all EntryDetail for POS Entries.
//
// A POS Entry is a debit Entry initiated at an “electronic terminal” to a consumer
// account of the receiver to pay an obligation incurred in a point- of-sale
// transaction, or to effect a point-of-sale terminal cash withdrawal.
//
// Point-of-Sale Entries (POS) are ACH debit entries typically initiated by the use
// of a merchant-issued plastic card to pay an obligation at the point-of-sale. Much
// like a financial institution issued debit card, the merchant- issued debit card is
// swiped at the point-of-sale and approved for use; however, the authorization only
// verifies the card is open, active and within the card's limits—it does not verify
// the Receiver's account balance or debit the account at the time of the purchase.
// Settlement of the transaction moves from the card network to the ACH Network through
// the creation of a POS entry by the card issuer to debit the Receiver's account.
